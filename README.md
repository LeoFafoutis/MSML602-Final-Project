# MSML602-Final-Project

Project Name: Analysis of Player versus Character impact in Esports.

Topic: In esports, and most multiplayer video games in general, certain characters or loadouts are typically stronger or weaker than others. This project will focus on the impact of a player's skill versus the performance of the specific characters they play, to determine how both factors affect overall performance and results.
